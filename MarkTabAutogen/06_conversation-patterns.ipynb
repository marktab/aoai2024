        "# Conversation Patterns\n\nIn the previous chapter we used two-agent conversation, which\ncan be started by the `initiate_chat` method.\nTwo-agent chat is a useful conversation pattern but AutoGen offers more.\nIn this chapter, we will first dig a little bit more into the two-agent \nchat pattern and chat result, \nthen we will show you several conversation patterns that involve \nmore than two agents.\n\n### An Overview\n\n1. **Two-agent chat**: the simplest form of conversation pattern where two agents chat with each other.\n2. **Sequential chat**: a sequence of chats between two agents, chained together by a carryover mechanism, which brings the summary of the previous chat to the context of the next chat.\n3. **Group Chat**: a single chat involving more than two agents. An important question in group chat is: What agent should be next to speak? To support different scenarios, we provide different ways to organize agents in a group chat:\n    - We support several strategies to select the next agent: `round_robin`, `random`, `manual` (human selection), and `auto` (Default, using an LLM to decide).\n    - We provide a way to constrain the selection of the next speaker (See examples below).\n    - We allow you to pass in a function to customize the selection of the next speaker. With this feature, you can build a **StateFlow** model which allows a deterministic workflow among your agents.\n Please refer to this [guide](/docs/topics/groupchat/customized_speaker_selection) and this [blog post](/blog/2024/02/29/StateFlow) on StateFlow for more details.\n4. **Nested Chat**: package a workflow into a single agent for reuse in a larger workflow."

        "## Two-Agent Chat and Chat Result\n\nTwo-agent chat is the simplest form of conversation pattern. \nWe start a two-agent chat using the `initiate_chat` method of every \n`ConversableAgent` agent.\nWe have already\nseen multiple examples of two-agent chats in previous chapters\nbut we haven't covered the details.\n\nThe following figure illustrates how two-agent chat works.\n\n\n![Two-agent chat](./assets/two-agent-chat.png)\n\nA two-agent chats takes two inputs: a message, which is a string provided by\nthe caller; a context, which specifies various parameters of the chat.\nThe sender agent uses its chat initializer method\n(i.e., `generate_init_message` method of `ConversableAgent`)\nto generate an initial message from the inputs, and\nsends it to the recipient agent to start the chat.\nThe sender agent is the agent whose `initiate_chat` method is called, and\nthe recipient agent is the other agent.\n\nOnce the chat terminates, the history of the chat is processed by a \nchat summarizer. The summarizer summarizes the chat history and calculates\nthe token usage of the chat. \nYou can configure the type of summary using the `summary_method`\nparameter of the `initiate_chat` method. By default, it is the last\nmessage of the chat (i.e., `summary_method='last_msg'`).\n\nThe example below is a two-agent chat between a student agent and a teacher\nagent. Its summarizer uses an LLM-based summary."

It states that for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than or equal to the length of the remaining side. In mathematical terms, if a triangle has sides of lengths \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), then the triangle inequality can be expressed as:\n\n1. \\(a + b \\geq c\\)\n2. \\(a + c \\geq b\\)\n3. \\(b + c \\geq a\\)\n\nThese inequalities must hold true for a set of three lengths to form a valid triangle. If any of these inequalities are violated, the given lengths cannot form a triangle.\n\nThe triangle inequality also applies in more general settings, such as in vector spaces and metric spaces, where it helps define notions of distance and is used in proving various mathematical theorems.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u001b[31m\n>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...\u001b[0m\n\u001b[33mStudent_Agent\u001b[0m (to Teacher_Agent):\n\nI think I understood that! So, for any three sides to form a triangle, the sum of any two sides must always be greater than or equal to the third side. Could you give me an example to illustrate this concept?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u001b[31m\n>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...\u001b[0m\n\u001b[33mTeacher_Agent\u001b[0m (to Student_Agent):\n\nTeacher_Agent\nOf course! Let's consider three sides with lengths \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). We'll put some actual numbers to these lengths for clarity.\n\nExample 1: Valid Triangle\n\nSuppose the sides of the triangle have lengths \\(a = 3\\), \\(b = 4\\), and \\(c = 5\\). Let's check if these sides satisfy the triangle inequality:\n\n1. \\(a + b = 3 + 4 = 7 \\geq 5 = c\\). This is true.\n2. \\(a + c = 3 + 5 = 8 \\geq 4 = b\\). This is true.\n3. \\(b + c = 4 + 5 = 9 \\geq 3 = a\\). This is true.\n\nSince all three inequalities are satisfied, the sides \\(3\\), \\(4\\), and \\(5\\) can form a valid triangle.\n\nExample 2: Invalid Triangle\n\nNow, suppose we have sides with lengths \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = 3\\), and \\(c = 6\\). Let's check if these sides satisfy the triangle inequality:\n\n1. \\(a + b = 2 + 3 = 5 \\geq 6 = c\\). This is false.\n2. \\(a + c = 2 + 6 = 8 \\geq 3 = b\\). This is true.\n3. \\(b + c = 3 + 6 = 9 \\geq 2 = a\\). This is true.\n\nThe first inequality \\(2 + 3 \\geq 6\\) is not satisfied. Therefore, the sides \\(2\\), \\(3\\), and \\(6\\) cannot form a valid triangle.\n\nIn summary, for any set of three lengths to form a triangle, they must satisfy all three conditions of the triangle inequality.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"

        "## Group Chat\n\nSo far we have only seen conversation patterns that involve two agents or \na sequence of two-agent chats. AutoGen provides a more general conversation\npattern called group chat, which involves more than two agents.\nThe core idea of group chat is that all agents contribute to a single\nconversation thread and share the same context.\nThis is useful for tasks that require collaboration among multiple agents.\n\nThe figure below illustrates how group chat works.\n\n![group_chat](./assets/group-chat.png)\n\nA group chat is orchestrated by a special\nagent type `GroupChatManager`. In the first step of the group chat,\nthe Group Chat Manager selects an agent to speak. Then, the selected agent\nspeaks and the message is sent back to the Group Chat Manager,\nwho **broadcasts** the message to all other agents in the group.\nThis process repeats until the conversation stops.\n\nThe Group Chat Manager can use several strategies to select the next agent.\nCurrently, the following strategies are supported:\n\n1. `round_robin`: The Group Chat Manager selects agents in a round-robin\n   fashion based on the order of the agents provided.\n2. `random`: The Group Chat Manager selects agents randomly.\n3. `manual`: The Group Chat Manager selects agents by asking for human input.\n4. `auto`: The default strategy, which selects agents using the Group Chat\n   Manager's LLM."
