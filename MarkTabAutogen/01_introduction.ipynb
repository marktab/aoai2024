        "## Why AutoGen?\n\n> _The whole is greater than the sum of its parts._<br/>\n> -**Aristotle**\n\nWhile there are many definitions of agents, in AutoGen, an agent is an entity that can send messages, receive messages and generate a reply using models, tools, human inputs or a mixture of them.\nThis abstraction not only allows agents to model real-world and abstract entities, such as people and algorithms, but it also simplifies implementation of complex workflows as collaboration among agents.\n\nFurther, AutoGen is extensible and composable: you can extend a simple agent with customizable components and create workflows that can combine these agents and power a more sophisticated agent, resulting in implementations that are modular and easy to maintain.\n\nMost importantly, AutoGen is developed by a vibrant community of researchers\nand engineers. It incorporates the latest research in multi-agent systems\nand has been used in many real-world applications, including agent platform,\nadvertising, AI employees, blog/article writing, blockchain, calculate burned areas by wildfires,\ncustomer support, cybersecurity, data analytics, debate, education, finance, gaming, legal consultation,\nresearch, robotics, sales/marketing, social simulation, software engineering,\nsoftware security, supply chain, t-shirt design, training data generation, Youtube service..."
